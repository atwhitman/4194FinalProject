Discussed various ways to handle raw data.
	-Missing data?
	-Decided to use 6 channel input to network
		-1-D convolutions

	- could use 2 channel (acc x,y,z and gyro x,y,z), 2 channel( acc magnitude and gyro magnitude), or 1 channel (1x6: acc x,y,z gyro x,y,x)

Discussed different network architures.
	-LSTM? 
	-Audio classifiers? 
	-Kernel size, network depth, and data normalization are important unknowns currently	


Discussed different baseline comparisons
	- Original paper achieves approximately 90% accuracy via SVM


Short term goals:

	Alex:
		- Look into handling different length inputs via zero padding

	Benji: 
		- Look into windowing measurements and using shorter sample lengths

	Michael:
		- Look into current network architectures that are used for time-series classification
